# SOC Analyst I — From Cradle to Grave

A practical, intensive 8-module cybersecurity course designed to transform an aspiring professional into a job-ready Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst I.

## Course Overview

This course focuses on real-world incident response, detection engineering, and threat hunting across modern hybrid environments (Windows, Linux, and AWS Cloud). The curriculum is structured around the 8 most common and critical attack types a Tier 1 SOC analyst will face, providing a hands-on, portfolio-building experience.

## Course Structure

### 8 Core Modules

1. **Phishing Attack** — The Gateway Incident
2. **Unauthorized Access** — The Insider & External Threat
3. **Data Loss / Exfiltration** — Protecting the Crown Jewels
4. **DDoS Attack** — Availability and Resilience
5. **Malware Attack** — The Hostile Takeover
6. **Detection Engineering** — Building the Defenses
7. **Live Attack & Defense** — The Capstone Simulation
8. **SOC Interview Simulation** — Career Readiness

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this course, you will be able to:

- Handle Tier 1 SOC tickets end-to-end
- Perform triage on phishing, malware, DDoS, data exfiltration, and unauthorized access
- Write clean, concise SOC reports and ticket updates
- Perform NetFlow and PCAP traffic analysis
- Investigate host-based logs on Linux and Windows
- Run memory forensics
- Execute OSINT enrichment
- Create detection rules using Suricata, YARA, Sigma
- Operate in hybrid environments (Windows + Linux + AWS CloudTrail + VPC Flow Logs)
- Respond to live, simulated attack campaigns
- Pass SOC Tier 1 and Tier 2 interviews with confidence
- Create a public cybersecurity portfolio with real projects
